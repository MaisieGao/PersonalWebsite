            I am a Chinese CS align student who previous majored in accounting.
            I lived in the U.S. for seven years before I came to Vancouver. I
            know four languages: Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, and English. I was
            a top student at school and had several job experiences both in the
            accounting and finance fields in both the U.S. and China. I have
            passed all CPA sections and the Chinese National Judicial
            Examination (bar exam in the U.S).

            My most recent job experience was as a financial analyst at a small
            P/E firm in China. I analyzed companies' financial and accounting
            reports comparing with the average data in the industry with the
            manager's help and wrote financial reports using business analysis
            tools such as competitive analysis, financial ratios, SWOT analysis,
            five force analysis finance and accounting calculations.

            In the U.S., I worked as a financial analyst and accounting intern
            at Mcgraw-hill education. I was mainly helping with the M&A process.
            I also helped build budgeting excel sheets and updated budget
            guidelines. I also analyzed competitor financial and operational
            information, financial statements, and performance, including the
            review of SEC filings and wrote analysis reports for our team.
          </p>

            I was an accounting intern at Nomad Financial, an accounting firm
            that management accounting functions for startup companies. I have
            gained exposure to more than 15 companies by joining clients'
            meetings, and I learned to read between the lines to address
            clients' needs in order to provide a quality experience. I took part
            in the entire accounting process including weekly A/R and A/P data
            entries,1099 tax work at year-end, employee and payroll expenses
            categorization, Bank reconciliation and depreciation, prepaid
            expense, and convertible notes reports using excel, QuickBooks,
            Xero, and bill.com. My manager trusted me with handling more and
            more complicated accounting works, and I have learned to prioritize
            my work for different clients and work efficiently under tight
            deadlines and clients' budgets.
          </p>

            I have also had a full-time accounting intern work experience at
            Propel fuels for almost a year. During that period, I received and
            recorded invoices applying excel models that I created using pivot
            tables and VLOOKUP to avoid mistakes and uploaded the organized data
            into QuickBooks. Then I used QuickBooks to pay vendors and prepared
            for bank reconciliation. With the huge amount of data entry work for
            more than 30 vendors, I managed to make ends closing every month
            quicker with barely any mistakes for rechecking.
